Gain & Grain

### What you planned to do
* New post front end #8 https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/8
* Navbar component #19 https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/19
* Button styling #15 https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/15

### What you did not do
* Peyton did the new post front end instead of me
* I wanted to get an upload image or video process done
* I wanted to work on some type of back end, but I'm unfamiliar with doing that.

### What problems you encountered
Some problems I encountered include not being familiar with nextjs, not having experience with git, and having so many other
assignments to work on at the same time I had to do this one, including preparing for 2 exams.

* gain-grain/src/components/Navbar.js
* gain-grain/src/app/profile/page.js



### What you accomplished
I added some features including a button and navbar. The navbar was actually originally from Trevor's home page, but
I thought that it would be a good feature to include in some of other pages. I also worked on our basic profile page layout.
Once we have some backend features implemented we could make it so that we can actually add new users and make the customizable
profile page. I also made a couple pages just to understand the idea of making and linking pages together.
