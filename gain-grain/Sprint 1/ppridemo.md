Gain & Grain

## What you planned to do
- Implement Dark Mode [#1](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/1)
- Create a calendar to track workouts and meals [#7](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/7)
- Create UI frameworks for creating posts [#14](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/14)

## What you did not do
- Dark Mode, not needed as out css files can account for browser preferences 
- Calendar, I completed the inital set up of the calendar. Due to miscomunication we had two people both working on the calendar and we went with Trevor's implementation as it was more complete.
## What problems you encountered
- Unfamilar with these tools so a lot of trial and error
- Calendar wasted time, as we had two people working on it

## Issues you worked on

- Create a calendar to track workouts and meals [#7](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/7)
- Create UI frameworks for creating posts [#14](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/14)

## Files you worked on
- /src/app/dashboard/calendar.css
- /src/app/dashboard/custom_calendar.css
- /src/app/post/post-blog/page.js
- /src/app/post/post-meals/page.js
- /src/app/post/post-progress-pictures/page.js
- /src/app/post/post-workouts/page.js   
- /src/app/post/page.js
- /src/app/post/page.css

## What you accomplished
I completed the initial setup of a functional calendar that would display the days, months, and years in an organized manner. However this calendar was scrapped due to miscommuncation. I then moved on to designing and creating the post creation pages. I completed the inital setup of the pages and began on adding details and accessible design for proofs of concept.

Over all I feel accomplished in the sense that I gotten slightly better navigating these tools, working as a team, and contributing to a code base.
