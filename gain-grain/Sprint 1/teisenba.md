### What you planned to do
(Give a short bulleted list of the items you planned to do for this sprint. Include the github issue number and link to the issue)
* Create the homepage, which has posts, comments, and a nav bar to get to the other parts of the site
* [gh-16](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/16)
* Create the navbar to go on the home page and other pages of the website
* [gh-5](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/5)
* Create the use calendar and the appropriate tab for it and add the ability to add meals and workouts to the calendar in a todo-list format
* [gh-4](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/4)

### What you did not do
* Add the ability to add meals and workouts to the calendar in a todo-list format (done by Brodie Kovach)

### What problems you encountered
* I jumped right into the html/css/js without properly learning it first, so my first mockups were pretty rough. I should have spent more time
* learning before starting to write code because it would've saved me more time in the long run
* Text for buttons on homepage is turning the wrong color, which is possible a global file issue
* Integrating the logic for adding meals and workouts Brodie wrote to the calendar I wrote

### Issues you worked on

[gh-16](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/16)

### Files you worked on
(Give a bulleted list of the files in your github repo that you worked on. Give the full pathname.)
* gain-grain/src/app/app.css
* gain-grain/src/app/globals.css
* gain-grain/src/app/layout.js
* gain-grain/src/app/page.js
* gain-grain/src/app/dashboard/custom_calendar.css
* gain-grain/src/app/dashboard/page.js
* gain-grain/src/app/dashboard/style.css
* Multiple now-deleted files for the old calendar and homepage that I upgraded

### What you accomplished
* I created the homepage that the user is immediately launched to upon opening the website. This homepage includes user posts, comments,
* and likes.
* I created the navbar that sits at the top of the webpages. This navbar allows you to get from place to place on the website and perform
* important tasks such as logging in to your profile.
* I created the calendar that is used to keep track of individual users' progress. Later, I worked closely with Brodie Kovach to integrate
* the functionality he wrote to add exercises and meals to a certain day
