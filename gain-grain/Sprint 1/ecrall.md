# Sprint 1

* Name: Ethan Crall
* Github ID: ethancrall
* Group Name: Gain & Grain

### What I planned to do
* Frontend and backend for login page ([Issue #2](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/2))
* Frontend and backend for registration page ([Issue #3](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/3))
* Frontend and backend for forgot password page ([Issue #9](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/9))

### What you did not do
* I wasn't able to get the backend done for the login, registration, and forgot password pages

### What problems you encountered
* I underestimated how long the frontend would take to design for the three different pages. I wanted them to look very nice because, after all, these are some of the first pages a user will see when they enter our website.
* The Next.js learning curve was a lot steeper than I expected. Writing the frontend code was hard enough with the different Next syntax, but when I attempted to add my backend JavaScript code, it proved to be even more difficult to get all the moving parts working together.

### Issues you worked on
* [Issue #2](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/2)
* [Issue #3](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/3)
* [Issue #9](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/9)

### Files you worked on
* Login frontend
    * gain-grain/src/app/login/page.js
    * gain-grain/src/app/login/login.modules.css
* Forgot password frontend
    * gain-grain/src/app/login/forgot/page.js
    * gain-grain/src/app/login/forgot/forgot.modules.css
* Register frontend
    * gain-grain/src/app/register/page.js
    * gain-grain/src/app/register/register.modules.css

The following files I wrote when attempting to create the backend components for login/register but they aren't fully functional/compatible with Next.js:

* User model
    * gain-grain/src/utils/userModel.js
* Login backend
    * gain-grain/src/app/api/login/login.js
* Register backend
    * gain-grain/src/app/api/register/register.js


### What you accomplished

In Sprint 1, I wrote the CSS and HTML for the user login, register, and forgot password pages.
Our group made it a priority to get the website all laid out first before moving on to the backend components of it. Torwards the end of the sprint, I attempted to reach the goal I set for myself at the beginning of the sprint (making the frontend _and_ backend for all three pages) but couldn't figure out how to get it all working in time. Although I fell short, I feel that I made good progress and set a great foundation for the project. Creating the backend will be my focus for Sprint 2.
