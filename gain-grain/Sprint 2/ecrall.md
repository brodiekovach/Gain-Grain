# Sprint 2

* Name: Ethan Crall
* Github ID: ethancrall
* Group Name: Gain & Grain

### What I planned to do
* Complete backend for login page ([Issue #18](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/18))
* Complete backend for register page ([Issue #20](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/20))
* Complete backend for forgot password page ([Issue #21](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/21))

### What I did not do
* I completed all the goals I set for myself.

### What problems I encountered
