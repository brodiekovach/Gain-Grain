# Sprint 2

Gain & Grain

## What you planned to do

I planned to :

- add UI to the different post pages
- link up the UI to the backend for database updates
- add a third issue that fits what is needed next along following this theme

## What you did not do

- I did not complete the post creation functionality, the backend connection has been harder than I thought and I will continue this issue into Sprint 3.
- I did not get to the third issue as the above took the majority of my time

## What problems you encountered

- Unfamilar with working with API routes and interacting with a database.

## Issues you worked on

- Post Creation Functionality [#25](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/25)
- Further Streamline the UI/UX of the post creation pages [#26](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/26)

## Files you worked on

- /src/app/api/posts/route.js

## What you accomplished

This sprint was a learning curve for me, as the frontend backend connection was a lot more complicated than I antipated. However, I can wholeheartedly say that I have left this sprint with more knowledge about interacting with APIs as well as Next projects in general.

However, my experience in the front-end in Sprint 1 has paid off as I have been able to add more functional features to existing web pages. It is extremely satisfying to see what I have been able to do in 4 weeks with a toolset I knew next to nothing about.
