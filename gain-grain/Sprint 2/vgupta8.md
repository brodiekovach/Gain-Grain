# Sprint 2

Viwesh Gupta
V1w35h 
Gain & Grain

### What you planned to do
* Notification page #35 https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/35
* Profile Customization #23 https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/23
* Follow Feature #22 https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/22

### What you did not do
* I did not make the follow feature, I think that firstly we need to have a good search for other users before you'd be able to follow another user.
* I only got to make a page that holds profile customization, it doesn't change the things that you actually changed though
* I tried to make it so that after you log in, you will be taken to your own profile page when you go to it, but Ethan took over that part

### What problems you encountered
Some problems I encountered were when trying to work on the backend, I had no idea what I was doing. I tried to follow tutorials off of Youtube, but in the end Ethan had to rewrite the things that I had attempted to do. I feel that I could have done a lot more for this sprint, but the things that I tried to do ended up being pointless and had to be rewritten. One thing that I'm going to work on moving forward is getting together with groupmates in person to work on my issues so that I can ask questions to them about things that they had written.

### Issues you worked on
* [#6] https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/6
* [#19] https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/19

### Files you worked on
(Give a bulleted list of the files in your github repo that you worked on. Give the full pathname.)
* gain-grain/src/app/dashboard/notifications/page.js
* gain-grain/src/app/utils/userModel.js
* gain-grain/src/app/EditProfile/page.js
* gain-grain/src/app/profile/page.js



### What you accomplished
I only really got to add the Edit profile page and the notification page. I feel bad that I did not really do anything other than that and I hope to have more to add for this sprint.
