### What you planned to do
* Add functionality to count the amount of likes on a post
* [gh-40](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/40)
* Create a menu for the share button on posts to share to other sites 
* [gh-38](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/38)
* Improve the overall quality of code throughout the project

### What you did not do
* Although originally intended, I did not end up creating a share button for the posts.
* Instead, we as a group decided to replace that with the "save" button to save posts
* to ones page.

### What problems you encountered
* I had a lot of trouble parsing through the many different files necessary to add likes functionality. 
* After finally getting the likes to work correctly on both the front and backend, Brodie, Ethan and I
* had major rebasing that needed to be fixed

### Issues you worked on
* [gh-38](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/38)
* [gh-40](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/40)

### Files you worked on
* gain-grain/src/app/api/posts/route.js
* gain-grain/src/components/Post.js
* gain-grain/src/middleware.js
* gain-grain/src/utils/postModels/Post.js
* gain-grain/src/utils/userPosts.js
* gain-grain/src/app/profile/page.js


### What you accomplished
* This sprint, I was able to get the likes functionality working for posts. I also moderately
* improved the post schema and formatting and worked ahead to create a comments schema for the future.
* I was also able to solve major rebasing issues we had just before the sprint deadline.
