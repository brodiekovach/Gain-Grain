Gain & Grain

### What you planned to do
* Profile page Frontend/Backend #52 https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/52
* update notification page #47 https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/47
* Profile functionality #45 https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/45

### What you did not do
* This sprint I got a good opportunity to work on everything that I had planned to do.
* There was a few things that I had planned to do but Ethan took over on them, like updating your profile page, but I still got some work done on it
* I could not get the profile picture of the user that followed you to show up on the notifications page

### What problems you encountered
Some problems I encountered were when I was making the saved workouts show up on your profile page, it would make the website tweak out and was constantly calling '/api/profile/get-user-from-session' over and over and over again. Ethan ended up fixing that issue. I had problems with the notifications in getting a profile picture to show up, so I may have to work on that next sprint.

### What you accomplished
I got a lot of work done on UI/UX for profile pages. I also worked on notifications and got the page done as well as an extra feature on the navbar. I'm very proud of the work that I got done this sprint.
