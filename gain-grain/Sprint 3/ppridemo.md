## What you planned to do

I planned to :

Straighforward but vastly important this sprint

- Link the posts to the database
- Render a Post to the home page

## What you did not do

- Rendering the posts to the home page was not completed, however I assisted with rendering them on the profile page.

## What problems you encountered

- Backend API calls caused quite a bit of issues at first when trying to work around the middleware (cookie authentication)
- Getting the API getters to actually move the data to the correct places

## Issues you worked on

- Create a GET request for blogs [#60](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/60)
- Create back-end for Posting Workouts [#42](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/42)
- Create the back-end for Posting Blogs [#39](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Gain-Grain/issues/39)

## What you accomplished

This sprint was slower-paced on my end as it was entirely back-end. I would write code, test it using tools like PostMan and then rinse and repeat. This process was painstaking, but rewarding when in both results and teaching me how to debug and test back-end code. I accomplished what I set out to do, which was link the post pages to the database and create functions to help retrieve it for rendering. After reaching the 6 week mark I am impressed on what I have been able to contribute to a project and framework I knew next to nothing about.
