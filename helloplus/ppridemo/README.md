# DARK MODE

This program uses html, css, and javascript to create a "darkmode" toggle. What it really does is change the white to black and vice-versa. 

I am not familar with the tools I will be using, so I took inspiration from a tutorial and modified the code.

To run:

1) I am using a VSCode extension called "Live Preview" that allows for html files to be rendered without being in a browser.

2) You can also run "npm start" (run npm install to install the dependencies from the package.json file first) and it should go to your devices localhost:3000 on the browser. From there navigate to my directory.
