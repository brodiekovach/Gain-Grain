## Workout Queue
# Assignment 6

This is a very simple program that prompts a user to input a workout name, along with the weight they used,
how many sets they did,and how many repititions that they did. It then returns what you did in order. One thing that it does need work on is that it breaks when 
more than one word is given for the workout name. I did this in c plus plus, because I haven't had any
experience working with React JS. My goal is to work together with my teammates to learn how I can shift my idea
from the c++ version into a usable version for our project.
