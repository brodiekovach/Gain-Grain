**Login Page**

This program is a login page for a user to login with their credentials.

**Running the Program**

To start, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. Next, clone the
repository, run "npm install" to install the packages, and run "npm start" to start
the server. Then, go to [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login) to view the login page. I have 
already made a user in the database with the username "ecrall" and the password 
"cs340-g&g-test". Test the login using these credentials and you will be navigated 
to the homepage. You can mess around with it and enter false credentials and see
the user will be denied access.

**How This Will Be Used**

This program can be used as the login page for our app. We will be using Node.js,
HTML, CSS, and MongoDB in our project so I think this will fit in nicely.
